Deris - A protocol-compatible Redis implementation written in Rust
==================================================================

This is **EXPERIMENTAL**, incomplete, and mostly done as a learning experiment.

Do not use it for anything serious.

It is coded against [rust](http://rust-lang.org) 0.6 and works only on nix for now
due to windows specific bugs in net::tcp.

Supported features
------------------

- Redis protocol
- GET
- SET (no flags)
